If I were a Renaissance Technologies trader and a student of Jim Simons, tasked with allocating a portfolio for an Indonesian client, my approach would be data-driven, systematic, and quantitatively rigorous. Before building any strategy or allocating capital, I would ask a comprehensive set of questions across the following domains:

---

* **What is your investment horizon?** long term
* **What is your target annual return?** is it possbile to outperform btc return?
* **What is your maximum acceptable drawdown or volatility?** 20% is ok
* **Do you require liquidity? If so, how much and how often?** no
* **Any ethical/religious constraint?** sharia-compliant
* **Is this portfolio personal, institutional, corporate, or part of a pension/insurance plan?** personal

---

### 💰 **2. Capital & Risk Profile**

* **What is the size of the capital to be allocated?** just assume from salary and any other income
